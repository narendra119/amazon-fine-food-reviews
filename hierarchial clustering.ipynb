      " I love holiday candies because they're predictably fresh (as opposed to the regular versions that have been sitting in a warehouse for 6 months - the holiday packaging ensures they're new stock).  Bought these from amazon for a great price despite mediocre reviews.  The reviews are true - this stuff wasn't handled with care - but the candies are still terrific.  They're visually a little waxy (visual eaters take note!) but the flavor is just a notch or two below ideal freshness and at least two notches above the non-holiday versions typically on my grocer's shelf.  Quite good.<br /><br />If you typically eat the Peanut Butter Cup (PBC) form, you may find the flavor of the holiday versions a little different.  The different shapes of the various holiday versions (bunnies, eggs, Christmas trees, etc.) alter the balance of peanut butter to chocolate in each bite.  There is a small finch-egg size PB egg (PBE) that is harder like the mini-cups.  It's actually interesting to geek out on the flavor differences between all the different shapes.  This oval egg is one of my absolute favorites - higher PB-per-bite balance, but still plenty enough chocolate.  The holiday shape versions are softer (no side ridging like the cups to add rigidity), with a different tooth-feel, and not as easy to transport without smushing.  This is a mini version of the soft PBE, and I found the flavor (PB to chocolate balance) virtually identical to the single-serving full-size PBE.<br /><br />If you happen to enjoy holiday PBEs, these mini-eggs are a sensible serving size without sacrificing the yummy texture and flavor of the larger PBEs.\n",

      " I have always bought and loved the clean \"fresh tuna\" tasting firm meat Polar Tuna when I bought it in my grocers.  But I purchased this product from Amazon in March 2010, and was very disappointed.  Although it looks firm and solid, (and the expiration date is for next November), it smells different, not that \"fresh tuna\" smell it used to have.  It also has that sharp bitter \"bad tuna\" aftertaste that most tuna seems to have for the last 5 or more years.  This bad aftertaste seems to coincide with the various preservatives they have added to tuna.  But on the can, this tuna says it only is \"Albacore, water, salt. Product of Thailand\".  If there is only water salt and tuna, then this tuna is bad. In the old days when I bought Polar tuna in the store, if I put the can in the trash, or left the dish on the counter for a few hours till I filled the dishwasher, it just smelled like fresh tuna smell.  But as soon as the can is opened from this 24 pack, the smell is bad, and it gets worse quickly.  As a last resort to see if something could remove the bad taste, I even tried cooking one can in tomato sauce, and I could still taste the bad tuna taste.<br /><br />I am disappointed, not only because of how it used to be so good, but also on the can it says: All Natural, NO ADDITIVES, NO RESIDUE, NO AFTERTASTE, and that is just not true.<br /><br />I have contacted them by email, and if they get back to me I will update this review.\n",

      " Got this the other day and have been mixing it with my dogs regular food so as not to be an abrupt change and let me tell you she loves this food.  It's dry but soft and puffy but it's nice to see some veggie like looking pieces in a dry dog food.  I can smell the sirloin beefyness more than any other dog food I've come across.<br /><br />I do like the fact that it is made by Purina which is my favorite company for my pet foods and I like the fact that I can give Maxine something that tastes good and not like saw dust.  I use just a bit more of this that her usual food because it is puffy already but if I compacted it I'm sure it would come to just a wee bit less that what she usually eats.<br /><br />My only problem with most dog foods this one included is the amount of crude fat.  Even though my baby is only eleven pounds and a bit small so doesn't really need to worry about a few extra calories it does stand that it would be nice to see more protien and less crude fat in the current dog foods out there.  My baby likes this and that counts for quite a bit.  Better than giving her table food which I do not believe in.\n",

      " It's very difficult to tell if this product is working. I applied it around my deck to repel rabbits. We have them in the yard, and sometimes they hover around the hostas around the deck. I haven't noticed any rabbits near the house since application, but we had rain nearly every day for a week, so I'm not sure if the product is effective anymore or not. I also sprinkled it around one of my gardens that doesn't have a fence to deter rabbits, groundhogs and moles. Since I don't have a camera set up, and I'm not monitoring it round the clock, I just can't tell if it's keeping all or some of them away.<br /><br />When I sprinkle it on, the product has a very strong smell of black pepper. It's easy to apply, but doesn't go very far. It's a little expensive for me to purchase for additional applications.<br /><br />For those wondering what the other 99% of inactive ingredients might be, I'm 99% sure it's sand. So, this is black pepper, Piperine, and Capsaicin, and a ton of sand.

      " We bought this with a coupon at our warehouse grocery store wondering if we'd ever use it all, but here we are on our second canister now! Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised. I absolutely expect us to remain regular buyers of Nesquik, it fits in nicely with my family!\n",

This tea is different it is not bitter.  It is smooth in taste.  I do not add sugar to my teas so they have to stand on their own.  This one does.  That is why I purchase teas with flavors in them.  This may seem expensive, but realize this is 100 bags of tea and comes in a huge box.  If you look a regular tea it is a much smaller box.  This looks over three times the size.

      " QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an \"olive oil gourmand\", I'd describe Colavita as \"rich, smooth, and neutral\". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as \"fruity\" (but a \"civilian\" would never call it fruity). It is not harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, not spicy like Whole Foods 360, and not notably \"olivey\".  Colavita is an evoo (\"extra virgin olive oil\"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means \"first pressing\".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words \"extra virgin\" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label \"extra virgin\" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.<br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauses, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sause, soup, stew, chili, cassrole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can \"go bad\"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  One usually purchases good cooking oil in multi-gallon tins.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil---albeit a bit expensive for a cooking oil.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0\">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sause or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W\">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an \"everyday\" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" salad oil.<br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of \"ordinary good\" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be substle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE\">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />The 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\n",

      " It's very difficult to tell if this product is working. I applied it around my deck to repel rabbits. We have them in the yard, and sometimes they hover around the hostas around the deck. I haven't noticed any rabbits near the house since application, but we had rain nearly every day for a week, so I'm not sure if the product is effective anymore or not. I also sprinkled it around one of my gardens that doesn't have a fence to deter rabbits, groundhogs and moles. Since I don't have a camera set up, and I'm not monitoring it round the clock, I just can't tell if it's keeping all or some of them away.<br /><br />When I sprinkle it on, the product has a very strong smell of black pepper. It's easy to apply, but doesn't go very far. It's a little expensive for me to purchase for additional applications.<br /><br />For those wondering what the other 99% of inactive ingredients might be, I'm 99% sure it's sand. So, this is black pepper, Piperine, and Capsaicin, and a ton of sand. If they made it in a liquid that customers could mix with sand for spreadability, I wonder if they could make it at a better price.\n",

      " We bought this with a coupon at our warehouse grocery store wondering if we'd ever use it all, but here we are on our second canister now! Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised. I absolutely expect us to remain regular buyers of Nesquik, it fits in nicely with my family!\n",

      " White Gold Raw Unfiltered Honey is wonderful.<br /><br />I've always loved honey...believed that the honey I purchased was just that...HONEY.  Ignorance is bliss...eh?  I've been really dismayed to discover that some of the honey (the processed/filtered/clear kind) out there is adulterated with HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS).  I HATE this stuff.  How would I or you know?  We can't...it's an impossibility...and that's exactly how HFCS manufacturers want to keep it.  If HFCS listed as an ingredient on any product I pick up at the grocery store I place it back on the shelf and walk away.  I'm sure that's EXACTLY why corn producers and HFCS manufacturers do not want regulations that require it being listed in the ingredients on products that contain HFCS...if we only knew.  Sadly, some bee farmers use HFCS to supplement their bees diets...could this be part of the cause for bee colony collapse?  I wonder.<br /><br />I'm stepping off my soapbox now and want you to know that this White Gold Raw/Unfiltered Honey is absolutely the best honey I've ever tasted.  It's mild, buttery, and aromatic all at the same time.  It just melts in your mouth and has a clean, yummy aftertaste.\n",

      " \"We use and believe in stone milling because no machinery has yet been developed that grinds grains into flours, cereals, and meals quite as well as the flint-hard quartz stones used by master millers since early Roman times.\" ~Bob's Red Mill Site<br /><br />The 100 % Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour is my favorite flour for use in a variety of whole wheat bread recipes. It is all natural and doesn't contain any preservatives. You can use this flour for bread machine baking too and it produces superior results. I've used the recipe on the back of the bag and adapted it by using a mixture of whole wheat and regular bread flour because I didn't have any \"gluten\" as called for in the recipe. If you substitute 1 ½ cups of regular bread flour for part of the whole wheat flour you don't seem to need the gluten.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill products remind me of my childhood when my father took me to the Graue Mill in Oakbrook, IL where we watched corn being milled. It is now the only operating waterwheel gristmill in Illinois. While Bob's Red Mill products don't arrive in a cloth bag, the paper bags do have an old fashioned feel and have a string-sewn closure. I love the crinkly sound of the high-quality paper bags.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill uses slow turning, 100-year-old millstones to naturally grind together the bran, endosperm and germ that contains the nutritious oil. This is a \"cool stone grinding process\" which preserves nutrients normally lost in high-speed, high-heat milling.<br /><br />This company produces more than 400 products. Look for everything from hot cereals and mixes to flour milled from a wide variety of grains.

      " My apologies in advance for what is a lengthy review.  However, if I can help anyone save a little time compared to what I spent trying to choose a good puppy food, that's my goal.  So I wrote this not only to review the Castor & Pollux product, but also to provide some information on other types of dry dog food.<br /><br />It is no secret that you can buy some very cheap and some very expensive dog/puppy foods.  Common sense tells you that you can spend very little and get lots of filler and by-products, or spend a good deal more and get wholesome, healthy food.  My personal opinion is that long term, both your dog and you are better off if s/he is fed good food.  The little extra money spent now may offset potential medical bills and heartache later.<br />That being the case, I set out to find a really good dog food for my Golden Retriever puppy, while, of course, trying to keep cost down.  I spent a good deal of time researching foods.  I disregarded low end foods that are largely grains, fillers and meat by-products.  I looked at average to premium foods.<br /><br />I narrowed my choices to several including Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix.  The others were Blue, Eukanuba, Innova EVO, Merrick, Natural Balance, and Wellness.<br /><br />After that I used a few review websites and ratings tables.  These can be helpful.  I used one that starts each perspective food off with 100 points and then subtracts for poor ingredients (example: -10 points of containing by-products) and then adds points for any really good ingredients - vegetables, etc.  The foods are then rated in grades from A through F.  Of my choices, all but one were in the A or higher range.  From these I eliminated Ekanuba first, which had a B rating.  Although it is what the breeder was feeding my puppy's litter, it appears to be average, at best, with some decent ingredients, but also containing by-products.<br /><br />Once I had established that the remaining contenders all ranked in the same range, I looked at price.  Now all of these will cost more than a store brand, but in the end your dog may end up healthier, which will make both him and you happier.<br /><br />Castor and Pollux ranked in the top 5 or so of the foods I looked at, and in the end it costs about $1.71 a pound using Amazon's \"Subscribe and Save\" program.  Plus it ends up shipped free to your home - which makes one less 15 pound item you need to lug home from grocery shopping!<br /><br />Now, this price is perhaps double a store brand, Alpo, or Purina, but those brands contain a lot of fillers and meat by-products, and you have no way of knowing what is in by-product.  Manufacturers are very good at fooling our eyes.  We read \"Meat By-products\" and we see \"meat\".  Yet at 85 cents a pound, you many no longer consider it a bargain when you realize \"meat by-products\" can include bones, blood, heads, lungs, intestines, ligaments, feet and feathers.  Not so yummy any more.<br /><br />The present ingredient list (all from the United States, by the way) for Castor & Pollux Natural Ultramix,  is as follows:<br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Turkey Meal, Milo, Ground Whole Oats, Ground Whole Barley, Dried Bananas, Chicken Fat (Naturally preserved with Mixed Tocopherols and Citric Acid), Brown Rice, Dried Peas, Natural Chicken Flavor, Salmon Meal, Tomato Pomace, Brewers Dried Yeast, Ground Whole Flaxseed, Dried Sweet Potatoes, Dried Carrots, Dried Egg Product, Potassium Chloride, Salt, Freeze Dried Peas, Dried Cranberries, Dicalcium Phosphate, Fructooligosaccharide, Calcium Carbonate, Zinc Sulfate, Vitamin E Supplement, Choline Chloride, Ferrous Sulfate, Niacin, Copper Sulfate, Thiamine Mononitrate, Calcium Pantothenate, Vitamin A Supplement, Manganous Oxide, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Sodium Selenite, Riboflavin, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Biotin, Vitamin B12 Supplement, Calcium Iodate, Folic Acid, Rosemary Extract.<br /><br />It contains very good protein sources such as poultry and poultry meal, as well as salmon meal, and its grain content comes from oats and barley.  It also includes a good mix of dried vegetables and fruits.  The dried fruits are easily visible.  They are decent size pieces, not microscopic.<br /><br />At first glance, you might think these ingredients aren't all that different than a less expensive brand like Iams.  However, aside from the aforementioned meat by-products, another key thing to look at is whether a food contains corn, especially in the first few ingredients.  Iams and many others will often include corn, which isn't worthwhile to your puppy.  Typically they lack dried vegetables/fruits, which Casto & Pollux contains - so while other brands might seem less expensive (and are per pound) in the long run you are paying for fillers.<br /><br />All in all, I think Natural Ultramix is a high grade dog food, but not at such a high cost as to prohibit using it on a regular basis.  It is smaller size kibble to make it easier for puppies to chew, and it does not have an offensive aroma (either in the bowl or in the air, if you know what I mean).<br /><br />PS - for anyone wondering why I chose this brand over the others, once I was satisfied I had found a few very good brands, it really just came down to the price and shopping availability among them, while still having the ingredients I desired (including vegetables & fruit).  I can tell you I found Dick Van Patten's \"Natural Balance\" to be a sleeper in the bunch.  I assumed that if the company tied a celebrity name to it, the product probably couldn't stand on its own, but based on ingredients, that looks like a good puppy food as well.\n",

Feel very liquid, more so than most baby food that I've bought.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. Due to puch design, baby food is wasted.\n",

      " When you love Indian food, but don't have the time to cook it, Kitchens of India is a really great alternative. I have yet to be disappointed in one of their dishes and this one is no exception. The great thing about Indian food is that they are mostly sauce (or \"gravy\" as they say), so I will cook up some meat or steam up some veggies and add one of these packets to make a fabulous meal. Their really aren't much in the way of veggies in these packets, but that is typical in Indian food, no matter where it comes from. American's tend to use gravy or sauce as the secondary component while Indian's use it as the primary component and sop it up with lots of bread or rice. By steaming or sauteing some additional vittles, you can really stretch one of these packets.\n",

      " QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an \"olive oil gourmand\", I'd describe Colavita as \"rich, smooth, and neutral\". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as \"fruity\" (but a \"civilian\" would never call it fruity). It is not harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, not spicy like Whole Foods 360, and not notably \"olivey\".  Colavita is an evoo (\"extra virgin olive oil\"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means \"first pressing\".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words \"extra virgin\" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label \"extra virgin\" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.<br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauses, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sause, soup, stew, chili, cassrole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can \"go bad\"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  One usually purchases good cooking oil in multi-gallon tins.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil---albeit a bit expensive for a cooking oil.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0\">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sause or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture. <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W\">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an \"everyday\" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good \"everyday\" salad oil.<br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of \"ordinary good\" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be substle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE\">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />The 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.\n",

      " Review:<br />I've eaten ramen for a long time (30+ years) and have eaten numerous varieties and the Shin ramen is probably my #1 tasting. The reasons are as follows:<br />* Best flavor broth - it's spicy (but adjustable), leaves a good aftertaste (yes, even when you burp), tint of mushroom flavor coupled with a good balance of red pepper, onions and spices.<br />* Noodles have good texture - depending how you cook them of course but with bad ones, no matter how you cook them they come out soggy/soft. These come out chewy if you want or softer if you overcook them.<br />* It's not oily - I've noticed with some noodles, you can see a ring of oil around the pot after you cook the noodles. So with these I sometimes had to boil an extra pot of water and then transfer the cooked noodles to the fresh pot of water to get rid of the oil. Not with Shin Ramen.<br />* Economical - for less than a dollar a pack, they beat any dollar menu item<br />* Great for any weather - particularly winter to keep you warm. In the summer, they help to break out a sweat and opens your pores<br />* Can be a hearty meal - you can add all types of things to this ramen as others have posted. An egg is recommended but so are vegetables and meat.<br /><br />Tips:<br /><br />Amount of water - add about 2 mug size cup fulls of water. If not sure, add a little less. You can always add more after it's fully cooked. Adding cold water at the end cools down the boiling hot soup so it's easier to eat.<br /><br />How to cook - wait til the water boils. As soon as it does, drop in everything: the soup base, noodles, dried vegie packet. If you want to add vegies, let it cook for about a minute before adding e.g. mushrooms, bean sprouts, tomatoes, green onions. Don't put more than a quarter couple of any vegies or meat cuz you'll kill the flavor. For eggs, if you like them well cooked, add them at the beginning. You can add at the end of cooking too but this is a bit too raw for my taste<br /><br />Cooking time - boil the noodles 2 - 4 minutes. This depends on how hard or soft you like your noodles. Just pull a strand out and taste it every 30 seconds after the first minute. There's no right or wrong here.<br /><br />Soup base - add all of it. Don't worry about it being too spicy. Per above you can always water it down later. The soup will be plenty hot. Remember it just finished boiling and it's difficult to put something in your mouth when it was just boiling.<br /><br />How to serve - there are 3 ways I'd recommend<br />1) The traditional Korean way - folks like to eat straight from the pot. There's actually an 'art' to this. After removing it from the stove, place the pot on something that wont burn. Grab the lid of the pot, a spoon (yes a spoon) and chop sticks (fork if you can't wield them).<br /><br />2) In a bowl. Don't use a plastic one unless it can stand the heat. I don't like to use plastic period for health reasons but up to you. Remove some of the excess soup from the pot first and then pour everything directly into the bowl. Grab a spoon and chopsticks/fork and place the bowl down and go to work.<br /><br />3) combination of 1 and 2 above. Place the pot of ramen and get a bowl along with a spoon and chopsticks/fork.<br /><br />How to eat:<br />First, forget what your parents have told you on slurping. To eat ramen, you must slurp. Why? Because 1) if you don't you'll burn your lips because no slurping means the noodles must pass through your lips slower and enclosed more around the noodles. 2) because your lips are more enclosed, most of the soup around the noodles are sucked away from noodles, leaving you with less flavorful noodles. So forget the decorum. Eat it asian style and slurp away.<br /><br />2nd, I'd recommend the Korean way (#1 above). You grab the pot lid then take about 2 mouthful amounts of noodle and dump it into the lid. You should be holding the lid with your left hand (switch if you're right handed) and quickly grab a large spoon and add several spoonfuls of soup broth into the lid. You're doing 3 things here 1) you're saturating the noodles with the flavorful broth. 2) by adding the noodles to the lid, you're cooling it down for consumption while keeping the rest of the noodles hot. 3) When you eat straight from the lid, you first eat the noodles and immediately follow up with a slurp from the lid itself to drink the soup base. To do this, you put the lid close to your mouth and then push the noodles in with your utensil, drink the soup right after or together as you push the noodles in. I know this sounds crude but the flavor is maximized this way. You can add any vegetables or meat to eat bite this way too.<br /><br />If you want to eat using method #2, well, it needs no explanation, just make sure you slurp and drink the broth as you eat the noodles.<br /><br />For method #3, you're basically substituting the bowl for the lid. Works as well but assuming your lid is metal, it keeps the noodles hotter. Also, people tend to put more noodles into a bowl then a lid and this ends up cooling the noodle down too much. It's also slower cuz you dont hold the bowl in your hand where as with the lid, since you're holding it, you grab noodles, place them briefly on the lid then straight to your mouth. It's cooler too ;>)<br /><br />Third, some people like to make this a heartier meal by adding rice. I usually don't add the rice to the pot until I'm half-way through because it's too hot and because the meal loses its flavor and it's too heavy. However, by adding rice directly to the pot full of ramen, you have more of a hearty meal.<br /><br />Now, enjoy!\n",

Each time I end up using two bags, it may just be that I prefer a stronger tea, but even the bags seem a bit smaller than normal, maybe it's intentional and I am overdoing it.  This product in particular is a good mix, ginseng, ginko, decaf green tea.  I tried to find a product with this blend for awhile with no luck.  The tea tastes great with some honey, it has a bit of an earthy taste, as to be expected, but it is not overpowering and the honey easily smooths it out.  Ginseng and ginko have a long history and many reported benefits, I do know buy into all of it, but some of it must be true.  Clinical studies have shown ginko to help people who have occasional claudication, but had no effect on individuals with noraml operating memories.  Of course green tea is antioxidant rich, and the longest living people drink it daily.  These things seem to change everyday though, I remember when butter was bad for us...  Basicaly, a good product, priced right.  Get's one star off for the weakness of the brew, but as I said, maybe it should get full stars and it was intentional.\n",

When using Sunbutter for baking you do have to cut back to about 1/2 of the baking soda and/or baking powder or you can add a little bit of lemon juice to prevent your baked goods from turning green from the sunflower seeds. If your cookies do turn green it doesn't affect the taste just the looks (guess how I know that little bit of information :).

When using Sunbutter for baking you do have to cut back to about 1/2 of the baking soda and/or baking powder or you can add a little bit of lemon juice to prevent your baked goods from turning green from the sunflower seeds. If your cookies do turn green it doesn't affect the taste just the looks (guess how I know that little bit of information :).
